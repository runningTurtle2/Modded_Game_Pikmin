# Pikmin Pluck
HTML Canvas Pikmin game. 
This was my web programming final project where me and a classmate (PurpleCactuar) were tasked with modifying an existing HTML canvas game.
Here is a link to the game instructions. http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/

Our task was to change the theme of the game along with adding animations, targets, scoring system, time limit, game over, and a bad guy. 

This code also includes a difficulty increase everytime the player gets hit by the monster. 

### Future Plans
**Primary Tasks**
- Improve UI
- Improve the user experience
- Provide sound bites or sound effects

**Maybe Later Tasks**
- Add music
- More interative surrounds within the game

**Above and Beyond**
- Create mutiple levels
- Different background, objects, and monsters
- Provide different mechanics
